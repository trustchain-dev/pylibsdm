NFC and NDEF introduction
=========================

In order to understand what SUN is all about, we first need
to establish some basics about NFC and NDEF.

NFC
---

*NFC*, or *Near Field Communication*, is, generally speaking,
a collection of protocols to transfer data between two devices
that are in close proximity. It is based on *RFID*, the standards
around *Radio-Frequency Identification*.

NFC devices can be *active* or *passive*:

- *Active* devices have their own power source, and can initiate
  communication with other devices; examples are smartphones or
  card readers attached to a PC
- *Passive* devices are *activated* by another devices, by an
  active device inducing power into their antenna and byt that
  powering up and booting the passive device; examples are NFC
  cards or tags
